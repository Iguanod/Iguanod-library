/**
 * An implementation of a counter (which associates keys with numbers) based on
 * a {@link java.util.Map}. This interface provides mehtods to encapsulate
 * operations such as adding or deducting values to the current value associated
 * with a key, or replacing the old value with a new one if the later is
 * higher/lower.
 *
 * <p>{@code Counter} operats with {@link java.lang.Number Numbers} to store the
 * values associated with the keys, but different classes subclassing
 * {@code Number} cannot be operated with one another directly. For that reason,
 * it is not natively possible to perform perfectly logical operations as adding
 * every mapping in a {@code Counter} that counts with {@code Intgers} to a
 * {@code Counter} that counts with {@code Doubles}. That's why an auxiliary
 * class called {@link es.iguanod.util.Caster Caster} is used to cast elements
 * of different classes to the appropriate class a given {@code Counter}
 * operates with.</p>
 *
 * <p>As the {@code Counter} interface extends the {@code Map} interface, all
 * the general contracts in {@code Map} should be maintained. However, the
 * {@code Counter} interfaces adds a couple of specifications. First of all,
 * {@code Map} allows for implementing classes to decide wether they want to
 * allow {@code null} keys and values, but {@code Counter} restricts this since
 * in a {@code Counter}, a single {@code null} key may or may not be allowed,
 * but {@code null} values are forbidden. Besides, the {@code Map} interface
 * specifies some methods as optional operations, which may be implemented to
 * allways throw
 * {@link java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException UnsupportedOperationException}
 * if the implementation is unmodifiable. {@code Counter} follows this pattern
 * so all its methods can throw {@code UnsupportedOperationException} if the
 * implementation is unmodifiable. However, an unmodifiable {@code Counter} (as
 * is presented in this interface, without any other methods) doesn't make a lot
 * of sense apart from its {@code Map} behaviour, as all the methods it adds
 * change the mappings. Anyway, the possibility to throw
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException} is allowed in case a subclass or
 * subinterface of {@code Counter} adds methods that don't modify the
 * {@code Counter}, in which case an unmodifiable {@code Map} and an
 * unmodifiable object of that sublcass of {@code Counter} wouldn't behave the
 * same.<p>
 *
 * @param <K> the class of the keys stored in the {@code Counter} with their
 * respective values
 * @param <V> a subclass of {@link java.lang.Number Number}, being the class of
 * the values associated with the keys stored in the {@code Counter}
 *
 * @see java.util.Map
 * @see es.iguanod.util.Caster
