/**
 * An object that may contain a reference to another object. Each instance of
 * this type either contains a reference (that may or may not be null), or
 * contains nothing (in which case we say that the reference is "absent").
 *
 * <p>A non-null {@code Maybe<T>} reference can be used as a replacement for a
 * {@code T} reference. It allows you to represent "a {@code T} that must be
 * present" (in which case you use simply a {@code T}) and a "a {@code T} that
 * might be absent" (in which case you use a {@code Maybe<T>}) as two distinct
 * types in your program, which can aid clarity.</p>
 *
 * <p>Some uses of this class include:<br/>
 *
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; As a method return type, as an alternative to
 * returning {@code null} to indicate that no value was available.<br/>
 *
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; To distinguish between "unknown" (for example,
 * not present in a map) and "known to have no value" (present in the map, with
 * value {@link es.iguanod.util.Maybe#ABSENT Maybe.ABSENT}).<br/>
 *
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; To wrap nullable references for storage in a
 * collection that does not support {@code null} (though there are several other
 * approaches to this that should be considered first).</p>
 *
 * <p>If an API uses {@code Maybes}, sometimes having a {@code Maybe<T>}
 * returned from a method instead of simply a &lt;T&gt; may seem like a burden.
 * Some examples may be when another API or method works with null values to
 * indicate non-present, or when printing a collection of {@code Maybes} and
 * wanting to print "null" for absent values. However, in those cases the
 * apparent problem may be circunvented using
 * {@code maybe.}{@link #or(Object) or}{@code (null)}.</p>
